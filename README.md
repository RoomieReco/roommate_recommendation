# roommate_recommendation
Hey there!
This repository is for a roommate recommender built by a team of 4 from the PGDM batch of Madras School of Economics.
This submission  is part of our graded project for our course on Data Science.
We first created a google form to collect data of users and used Google API to extract the data to python.
The recommender uses HEOM and KNN to extract recommendations.
A separate recommender for text and non-text data was made, the code also incorporates gender preferences.
Check out our repo and please feel free to fork and reach out to us.

Thanking you,
Team Roomie
